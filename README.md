This app is supposed to :

* list all venues a band has played in
* list all the bands, with functionality to add, delete, and update the bands
* create a checkbox to be able to check off what venues each band has played in
* make the name of all bands have capital letters at the beginning of each word no        matter how it is entered

Well, I fought the cold and a huge vomity migraine to get this done. The app was working all the way then something happened and gave me a weird 'sass-type' error(according to google--if it is a 'sass' error it is by pure happenstance, as I have zero knowledge of sass, other than hearing about it)

The code to delete and update bands is all there, but after I began to get the weird error, the app stopped working properly.

ugh. I seriously thought THIS one was gonna be the big winner as far as code reviews go--I was wrong--again. I cant wait to see whats up with this.
